# Open Source 101: Create your first open source project the “right way”

This repository contains the material for my presentation at Open Source 101 (http://opensource101.com/) titled: Create your first open source project the “right way” including:

* An outline of the presentation;
* The original artwork for the slides;
* A copy of the final slide deck presented at the conference;
* A Link to the Google Slides version of the presentation.



# Talk Abstract:

There are a lot of reasons to create an open source project but once you have decided to do it you owe it to yourself and your potential users and contributors to do it the “right way.” Of course there isn’t actually one “right way” to create an open source project but there are patterns you can follow to help your project be successful. In this fifteen minute talk I am going to cover a relatively simple pattern for creating and running your first open source project including the importance of documentation, testing, asking for help, and learning to let go if your project is fortunate enough to become popular.

# Repository Contents

In addition to this README this repository contains the materials I used to prepare and deliver the talk including the following items:

**Outline**

Coming soon...

**Slides**

In the slide directory you will find each individual slide in JPEG format. Each slide is named based on the theme of the slide (e.g. "golden_rule.jpg") to help make it easy to figure out which is which.

The original slides were created using SketchBook Pro (http://www.autodesk.com/products/sketchbook-pro/overview) on my iPad Air with a cheap stylus (you would never know I got my degree in art...)

**Slide Deck**

The original Google Slides presentation can be found at the following link:

The final presentation given at Open Source 101 in Raleigh, NC on February, 4th 2017 will be available in PDF format here: Open Source 101 - Doing it the -right way-.pdf
