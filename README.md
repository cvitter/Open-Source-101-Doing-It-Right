# Open Source 101: Create your first open source project the “right way”

This repository contains the material for my presentation at Open Source 101 (http://opensource101.com/) titled: Create your first open source project the “right way.”

# Talk Abstract:

There are a lot of reasons to create an open source project but once you have decided to do it you owe it to yourself and your potential users and contributors to do it the “right way.” Of course there isn’t actually one “right way” to create an open source project but there are patterns you can follow to help your project be successful. In this fifteen minute talk I am going to cover a relatively simple pattern for creating and running your first open source project including the importance of documentation, testing, asking for help, and learning to let go if your project is fortunate enough to become popular.
