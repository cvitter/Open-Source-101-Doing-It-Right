# Open Source 101: Create your first open source project the “right way” - Presentation Outline



## Slide 1 - Title Slide

* Good afternoon and welcome to "Create your first open source project the 'Right Way'."

## Slide 2 - Not An Expert

* Before we get too far into the presentation I need to make clear that I am not an expert in doing open source the 'Right Way.'

## Slide 3 - I Am A Fan!

* I am however a big fan!

* I have been working in and around open source since roughly 2010. 

* My fandom started out as a consumer of open source projects that helped me cobble together slightly useful applications that I was fortunate to get paid for.

* In 2012 I was part of a team that created an open source platform for document analysis called Infinit.e. It was surprising how exciting it was to release all of that that code into to the wild.

* Finally, in 2014, my career moved into a phase that involved selling open source. And yes, you can actually give away and sell open source software although the selling part can be more challenging than creating the software in the first place.

*  So for the last seven years I have made my living out of a combination of using, writing, and selling open source software...

## Slide 4 - Opinions

* That is to say that everything I say in this presentation is just a collection of my opinions and we all know what they say about opinions.

## Slide 5 - How Not Why

* So what we are going to talk about now is HOW to create an open source project not WHY.

* There are quite a few reasons WHY you might create an open source project but those are beyond the scope of this talk and some might argue better discussed with the aid of adult beverages.

* What I want to focus on is some of the things that you can do once you have decided to create an open source project to make it something that is beneficial to your intended audience.

## Slide 6 - "The Golden Rule"

* Let's start with an agreement that as open source developers we should all strive to follow the golden rule: "Release onto others as you would have them release onto you."

* In other words, create your open source project the way that you would want other developers to create their open source projects if you were going to use them.

* Unfortunately this golden rule doesn't really mean that you will end up profiting from your work...

## Slide 7 - Sad Face

* Or that others will follow the golden rule.

* If you have tried using other people's open source projects you might have felt like this.

* I have spent a lot of time metaphorically weeping while searching through open source projects to find something useful.

## Slide 8 - Todo List

* 

## Slide 9 - choosealicense.com

* If you are going to open source your project one of the first things that you will want to do is a pick a license under which to open source it.

* I tend to stick with the Apache 2.0 license because that's what I have the most experience with.

* That said I am not an expert on which license you should should choose so I highly recommend that you do some research.

* One great resource that makes it really simple to pick a license is choosealicense.com. If you aren't already familiar with it I highly recommend taking a look.

## Slide 10 - Github

* Let's be honest there are only a few places where you would choose to host your open source project and Github is the 900 pound Gorilla in the room.

* If you really want to look at alternatives like Bitbucket,  Microsoft's Codeplex, Slashdot Media's SourceForge (which itself used to be the 900 pound Gorilla). 

* I should note however that even Microsoft hosts its important open source projects on Gitbhub...

* The thing to remember about where to host your open source project is that it isn't just a place to dump your code where other people can access it. Whatever host you pick should have at least have features like support for your favorite source code control tool (git), a place to capture issues (more on that later), wikis and documentation (which we are going to talk about next).

## Slide 11 - Documentation

* One of my biggest pet peeves with a large number of open source projects is no, or lousy, documentation.
